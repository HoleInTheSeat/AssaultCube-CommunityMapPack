A long abonded stronghold - now in utter ruines - located somewhere in the Sahara. You cast one glance and you can tell: this place has seen glory now forgotten. Its walls rebuild many times, changing the place as time went by. A strong wind keeps the sand in the air. You cover your face and enter through a gap in the wall.

Welcome to Deserted.
