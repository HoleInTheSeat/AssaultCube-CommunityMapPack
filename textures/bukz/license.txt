These door textures are provided in the default texture package for AssaultCube in packages/textures/mitaman/3dcafe,
and have been slightly edited to align to the editor's grid differently, for use in the map ac_stellar by DES|Halo & DES|Bukz

Thanks to mitaman for making the original textures, and copyrights (if there is any) are still owned by him.
