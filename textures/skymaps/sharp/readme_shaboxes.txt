 To make things easier, I will explain it in casual words... Don't pirate these textures! Don't say
 you made them, or put a price on these and sell them! Don't edit and redistribute it! Ask for the
 authors permission first! You can use these skymaps for your maps and distribute them in your maps
 package, as long as you credit the author and... me for rearranging them ;-)
